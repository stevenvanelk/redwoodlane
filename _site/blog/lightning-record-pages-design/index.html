<p>We get it—Flows and Apex get all the attention. But <strong>great Lightning Record Pages</strong> can change how your team works every single day.</p>

<p>Here’s what we focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Page layouts that match business flow</strong>, not object structure</li>
  <li><strong>Tabs and visibility rules</strong> that reduce cognitive overload</li>
  <li><strong>Highlights, quick actions, and contextual components</strong> that help people do the right thing faster</li>
</ul>

<p>If your team has to scroll, guess, or tab-hop, your page layout is slowing them down. Let’s fix that.</p>
