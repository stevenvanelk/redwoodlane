<p>You can find endless Salesforce “best practices” online—but that doesn’t mean they’ll work for your org.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we’ve learned that the <em>right</em> solution depends entirely on your team, your process, and your goals.</p>

<p>Here’s what we do instead of relying on one-size-fits-all advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We ask more questions than we answer—at first.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>We study your data, usage patterns, and team behavior.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>We prototype solutions and test them with real users.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Smart consulting isn’t just about knowing the tools—it’s about knowing when <em>not</em> to use them. That’s where we come in.</p>
