<p>We love automation. But we’ve also seen how <strong>bad automation can cause more problems than it solves</strong>.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we focus on automating systems that are stable, repeatable, and worth the effort. Because automating noise? That just gets you noisy, faster.</p>

<p>Here’s how we evaluate what to automate:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Is the process well-defined?</strong> If not, we map it before we build.</li>
  <li><strong>Is it frequent and time-consuming?</strong> That’s a great candidate.</li>
  <li><strong>Does it reduce risk or error?</strong> Then it’s not just convenient—it’s valuable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Automation should make things smoother—not louder. We’ll help you get there.</p>
