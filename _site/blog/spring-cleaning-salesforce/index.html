<p>The best time to clean up your Salesforce org? Right before it becomes a problem.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we run regular <strong>org health checks</strong> for clients—especially in the spring. Here’s what we look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unused fields</strong> that clutter layouts and confuse users</li>
  <li><strong>Old automation</strong> (especially legacy Workflow Rules) that may still be running behind the scenes</li>
  <li><strong>Broken reports and dashboards</strong> that no longer reflect real business priorities</li>
</ul>

<p>We also help document what stays, what goes, and what gets archived—so your system stays lean, fast, and easy to manage.</p>

<p>A clean org is a healthy org. Let’s make it happen.</p>
