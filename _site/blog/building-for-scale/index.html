<p>You want your Salesforce org to support growth—but if you over-engineer it too early, you’ll slow down before you even speed up.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we help teams <strong>build for where they’re going</strong>—<em>without</em> burdening them with features they don’t need yet.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We design systems in phases</strong>, focusing on what drives value <em>right now</em></li>
  <li><strong>We create extensible structures</strong>, so new record types, processes, or users can be added cleanly later</li>
  <li><strong>We document the roadmap</strong>, so future devs (and admins) know what’s coming and why</li>
</ul>

<p>Scalable doesn’t have to mean complex. Let’s build smart—and stay nimble.</p>
