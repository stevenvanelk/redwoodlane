<p>Salesforce is a powerful platform—but many businesses barely scratch the surface.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we offer a Salesforce ROI Checkup: a quick but thorough review of your setup to identify where you’re underutilizing features you’re already paying for.</p>

<p>We often uncover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automation opportunities that reduce manual entry</li>
  <li>Reports that could drive better decision-making (if they existed)</li>
  <li>Licensing inefficiencies that quietly increase cost</li>
  <li>Data gaps that are blocking marketing or customer success</li>
</ul>

<p>Salesforce isn’t cheap—but when it’s configured strategically, it more than pays for itself. Let’s make sure that’s true for you.</p>
