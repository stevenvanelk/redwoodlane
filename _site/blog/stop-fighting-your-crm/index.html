<p>We’ve all seen it—teams using spreadsheets, sticky notes, or side conversations to avoid dealing with their CRM. It’s not laziness—it’s friction.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we help clients <strong>bridge the gap between process and platform</strong> so Salesforce actually <em>works</em> the way your team does.</p>

<p>Here’s what we focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Listening to users first</strong>, then configuring second</li>
  <li><strong>Reducing required clicks and fields</strong>—less busywork, more focus</li>
  <li><strong>Making it easy to do the right thing</strong>, so adoption is a natural outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>You shouldn’t need to convince your team to use Salesforce. You should make it something they <em>want</em> to use. We can help with that.</p>
