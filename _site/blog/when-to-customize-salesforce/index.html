<p>Salesforce is flexible—but that doesn’t mean <em>everything</em> needs to be custom-built.</p>

<p>At Redwood Lane, we help clients make smart customization decisions. Because the goal isn’t “custom”—it’s <strong>effective</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s how we think about it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Start With Configuration</strong><br />
Can a field, Flow, or Lightning page solve it? Use the tools Salesforce gives you first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Only Build What Adds Lasting Value</strong><br />
Custom objects, Apex, or LWCs should solve a real, ongoing need—not just this quarter’s pain point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design With Change in Mind</strong><br />
We always ask: will this be easy to maintain six months from now?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our best builds aren’t just clever—they’re durable. If your org feels like it’s overbuilt or underperforming, we can help rebalance it.</p>
