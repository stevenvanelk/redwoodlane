<p>A well-designed Flow can replace dozens of clicks, reduce errors, and improve team experience. At Redwood Lane, we treat Salesforce Flows like infrastructure—because they are.</p>

<p>Here’s how we use them to create real impact for clients:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lead-to-Opportunity Automation</strong><br />
We set up Flows to qualify and route leads based on smart logic—no more manual handoffs or missed follow-ups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Onboarding Workflows</strong><br />
New client? New hire? We design Flows that kick off checklists, tasks, and emails the moment a record hits a certain stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Alerting and Escalation</strong><br />
Need to know when something’s off? We build intelligent Flows that notify the right person at the right time—automatically.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If your org still relies heavily on manual updates or older tools like Workflow Rules, let’s talk. Flows aren’t just better—they’re the future.</p>
