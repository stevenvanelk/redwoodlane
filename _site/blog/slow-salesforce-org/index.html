<p>We’ve seen it more times than we can count: users start avoiding Salesforce—not because they don’t <em>like</em> it, but because it’s <strong>slow</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s how we help teams speed things up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplify page layouts</strong> so Lightning pages load fast and show only what matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Review record-triggered automation</strong> that could be causing backend lag.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze custom code</strong> for inefficiencies, loops, or unoptimized queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Speed is user experience. And user experience is adoption. If your org is dragging, let’s fix it before it starts costing real money.</p>
