<p>If your team dreads opening Salesforce, something’s broken—and it’s not their attitude.</p>

<p>We believe a good Salesforce org should feel like a <em>tool</em>, not a test.</p>

<p>Here’s how we improve the experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Smarter Lightning Pages</strong><br />
We remove clutter, surface the most relevant info, and design for speed—not endless scrolling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Guided Flows &amp; Quick Actions</strong><br />
We reduce guesswork by guiding users through complex processes with buttons, paths, and automation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Feedback Loops</strong><br />
We listen to your team, iterate based on usage, and measure what’s working.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your team isn’t using Salesforce the way you hoped, the problem might not be them. It might be the system. Let’s fix that.</p>
