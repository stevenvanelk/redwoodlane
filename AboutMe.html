                <p>Hi! I'm the founder of Redwood Lane, a dedicated Salesforce consultant specializing in Administration, Integrations, Automation, and Reporting.</p>
                <p>With years of experience optimizing Salesforce environments, I’ve helped businesses streamline their workflows, improve data management, and automate key processes.</p>
            </div>

        <p>Before diving into the Salesforce ecosystem, I worked as a creative professional in photography and video production. Storytelling has always been at the heart of what I do, whether through visuals or digital transformation. My background in crafting compelling narratives and solving creative challenges naturally transitioned into Salesforce, where I now help organizations build scalable solutions and seamless user experiences.</p>
        <h2>Salesforce Certifications</h2>
        <ul class="certifications">
            <li><i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> Salesforce Certified Administrator</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> Salesforce Certified Platform App Builder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Beyond Salesforce</h2>
        <p>When I’m not working with Salesforce, I’m spending time with my wife, Jenn, and our three kids. We love hiking, exploring nature, and playing board games together. Strategic thinking and problem-solving—which I use every day in my work—are also what I enjoy about board games, whether it’s a cooperative adventure or a head-to-head strategy challenge.</p>
        <p>Also, I’m a huge soccer fan. I support Chicago Fire in Major League Soccer and Aston Villa in the English Premier League.</p>
        <p>Beyond Salesforce and sports, I’m a self-proclaimed nerd. I love getting lost in fantasy novels, watching science fiction, and I won’t turn down a good podcast recommendation. If there were a Harry Potter-themed pub nearby serving butterbeer on tap, I’d probably be a regular. But since that’s not a thing (yet), trips to Harry Potter World with my family are the next best thing.</p>
        <p>Indiana has some incredible parks and hiking trails, and we take full advantage of them as a family. Whether it's discovering new paths, visiting waterfalls, or just getting outside to reset, nature is where we recharge. And when the colder months roll around, nothing beats a movie night on the couch—especially if it’s a romantic comedy or something sci-fi.</p>
        <h2>Why Redwood Lane?</h2>
        <p>At Redwood Lane, I bring together my technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and passion for efficiency to help businesses get the most out of their Salesforce investment. Whether it’s automating workflows, integrating third-party apps, or building dashboards that bring data to life, my goal is to make your Salesforce experience smoother, smarter, and more effective.</p>
