Salesforce is a powerful platform—but many businesses barely scratch the surface.

At Redwood Lane, we offer a Salesforce ROI Checkup: a quick but thorough review of your setup to identify where you’re underutilizing features you’re already paying for.

We often uncover:

- Automation opportunities that reduce manual entry
- Reports that could drive better decision-making (if they existed)
- Licensing inefficiencies that quietly increase cost
- Data gaps that are blocking marketing or customer success

Salesforce isn’t cheap—but when it’s configured strategically, it more than pays for itself. Let’s make sure that’s true for you.
