Used well, Record Types can clarify business processes, separate workflows, and simplify reporting.

Used poorly? They lead to layout sprawl, automation headaches, and endless picklist management.

## What Record Types Actually Do

At their core, Record Types let you:
- Show different **page layouts** to different teams
- Control **picklist values** based on context
- Segment **business processes** (like Sales Stages or Case Lifecycles)

That flexibility is powerful, but it comes with tradeoffs. Every new Record Type multiplies the number of layouts, flows, and picklists you may need to maintain. If you’ve ever had to update the same field in six different layouts, you know the pain.

## Common Pitfalls

Here are a few ways I’ve seen Record Types cause chaos:

- **“One per department” thinking** → suddenly you have 12 record types on the same object, half of which aren’t used consistently.  
- **Picklist overload** → admins forget that each Record Type controls picklist values, so adding a new value means touching every type.  
- **Automation breakdowns** → Flows or validation rules that don’t account for Record Type differences, leading to confusing errors for users.  
- **Layout sprawl** → maintaining dozens of near-identical layouts instead of reusing compact, universal designs.

---

## A Better Approach

When I design with Record Types, I focus on three principles:

1. **Tie them to real business logic**  
   Use Record Types when the process *actually diverges*. For example, Service Requests for “Travel” vs. “Dining” may need different lifecycles, not just different labels.

2. **Map page layouts carefully**  
   Don’t create a new layout unless the fields really differ. Instead, lean on Dynamic Forms and conditional visibility to keep things tidy.

3. **Track the impact on automation**  
   Every Flow, rule, and assignment process should be checked against Record Types. One missed condition can throw off the whole system.

---

## How to Decide: Do You Really Need a Record Type?

Here are some quick checks I use:

- **Do different groups of users follow completely different processes?**  
  → Record Types may help.

- **Do users just want different field labels or sections?**  
  → Dynamic Forms or permission sets are often better.

- **Will this change double (or triple) my maintenance work?**  
  → Be cautious; future you will thank present you.

Not every difference deserves a Record Type. Sometimes a single flexible layout with good field-level security is the simpler, cleaner solution.

---

## Example in Practice

I once worked with a client who had created **seven Case Record Types**—one per team. The result? Reporting was inconsistent, and nobody could agree on what “Open” meant because each Record Type had its own lifecycle.  

We simplified it to **two Record Types**: “Service” and “Internal.” Then we used picklists, Dynamic Forms, and assignment rules to handle the smaller differences. Reporting got cleaner, user training got easier, and admins cut maintenance time in half.

## Key Takeaways

- Use Record Types sparingly—only when processes *truly* differ.  
- Keep layouts as lean as possible with Dynamic Forms and conditional visibility.  
- Always consider the downstream impact on automation, picklists, and reporting.  

**Record Types should add clarity, not complexity.** When they do, your users spend less time fighting Salesforce and more time getting work done.
