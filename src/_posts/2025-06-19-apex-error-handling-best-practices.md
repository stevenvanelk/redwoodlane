Weâ€™ve all seen it â€” an Apex class with a try-catch block that does... nothing.

```apex
try {
    // business logic
} catch (Exception e) {
    // ðŸ™ˆ quietly fail
}

That kind of error handling makes troubleshooting a nightmare. If something breaks, you get no logs, no visibility, and no clue why.

Instead, hereâ€™s how we structure try-catch blocks to help us debug efficiently:

Log the error using System.debug(), or better yet, store it in a custom Error Log object with e.getMessage() and e.getStackTraceString()
Surface user-friendly messages only when appropriate â€” donâ€™t expose internals in UI errors
Avoid overbroad exception types â€” catching everything hides root causes
And when possible, wrap risky logic in helper methods to isolate failures. If you're logging email failures the same way you handle DML errors, itâ€™s time to refactor.

Solid error handling turns surprises into signals â€” and lets you fix issues before your users even notice.
