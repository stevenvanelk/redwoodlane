At Redwood Lane, we document *everything*. Not just for compliance—but for continuity, training, and trust.

Here’s what we deliver to clients as part of every major project:

- **Field maps and flow diagrams** that explain what’s happening behind the scenes  
- **Admin guides** that show how to update and maintain what we’ve built  
- **Change logs** that track what changed, why, and when  

Why? Because your system should outlast any single admin or consultant—including us.

### More Than a Safety Net  
Documentation isn’t just a safety net for when something breaks. It’s a foundation for decision-making. When you know exactly how your system works, you can move faster, onboard new team members with less stress, and avoid repeating old mistakes.  

### Reducing Risk  
Turnover happens. Projects get handed off. Without documentation, valuable context disappears with the people who leave. By capturing every step of the process, we reduce organizational risk and give your team the confidence to build on what’s already there.  

### Empowering Your Team  
Good documentation makes your team stronger. Admins and end users don’t need to guess or dig through old emails to figure out why a field exists or what a flow does. They have clear guides at their fingertips, which means fewer bottlenecks and smoother collaboration.  

### Future-Proofing Investments  
Every Salesforce implementation is an investment. Documentation ensures that investment keeps paying off long after the initial project is complete. Whether you’re scaling, integrating new tools, or simply troubleshooting, the record of what’s been done and why becomes a roadmap for the future.

**Bottom line:** Documentation may not be glamorous, but it’s one of the most valuable deliverables we provide. It’s how we make sure your Salesforce org isn’t just working today—it’s ready for tomorrow.
