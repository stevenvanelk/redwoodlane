Early in my Salesforce career, I used to build exactly what was asked.

“Can you add a checkbox?”
“Can you make a flow that assigns this to marketing?”
“Can we just copy this old spreadsheet into Salesforce?”

And guess what? Half the time, what I built wasn’t actually what they needed.

These days, I ask a better question first:  
> “What’s the problem you’re trying to solve?”

That question alone has changed my approach.

When a client asked for a “training completed” checkbox, it led to a conversation about tracking attendance across multiple sessions, logging instructor feedback, and showing a full training history — not something you can solve with a checkbox.

**Great admins and developers don’t just gather requirements — we uncover them.**

That means:
- Listening for pain points, not just feature requests
- Digging into how users work, not just what they say
- Validating your understanding before writing a single line of automation

Salesforce is powerful, but only when we solve the *right* problems. Better questions lead to better systems — and happier teams.
