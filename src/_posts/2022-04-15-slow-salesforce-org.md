We’ve seen it more times than we can count: users start avoiding Salesforce—not because they don’t *like* it, but because it’s **slow**.

Here’s how we help teams speed things up:

- **Simplify page layouts** so Lightning pages load fast and show only what matters.
- **Review record-triggered automation** that could be causing backend lag.
- **Analyze custom code** for inefficiencies, loops, or unoptimized queries.

Speed is user experience. And user experience is adoption. If your org is dragging, let’s fix it before it starts costing real money.
