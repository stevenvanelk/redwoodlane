Before we build anything, we dig in.

Our Salesforce Health Check is more than a checklist‚Äîit‚Äôs how we understand what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs risky, and what‚Äôs holding your team back.

## Why a Health Check Matters

It‚Äôs tempting to jump straight into building Flows, installing packages, or customizing layouts. But if the foundation of the org isn‚Äôt healthy, every new change sits on shaky ground.  

A Health Check helps you:
- Spot **technical debt** before it becomes unmanageable  
- Identify **quick wins** that improve adoption immediately  
- Prioritize projects based on actual risk and impact  

Whether we‚Äôre onboarding a new client or reviewing an existing environment, this audit gives us a clear picture of how the system is being used (and misused).

## What We Look For

### 1. Automation Overlap  
Multiple Flows, Workflow Rules, or Apex triggers running on the same object can cause unpredictable behavior. We check for:
- Flows firing in the wrong order  
- Workflow Rules that duplicate Flow logic  
- Triggers with no context on execution order  

üëâ A single update to a record shouldn‚Äôt kick off three separate automations that all do the same thing.

---

### 2. Page Layout Overload  
If users have to scroll through endless sections, adoption drops. We look for:
- Fields that are rarely used but still visible  
- Redundant sections that confuse users  
- Opportunities to apply **Dynamic Forms** for conditional visibility  

Clean layouts reduce cognitive load and make Salesforce feel more intuitive.

---

### 3. Data Quality Warning Signs  
Bad data equals bad reporting. We scan for:
- Incomplete or inconsistent records  
- Picklists with outdated or duplicate values  
- ‚ÄúOwner drift,‚Äù where inactive users still own accounts, opportunities, or cases  

Data quality fixes often provide some of the fastest ROI because they directly improve reporting and decision-making.

---

### 4. Scalability Blockers  
We look for technical patterns that work today but will break tomorrow, such as:
- Hardcoded IDs in Flows or Apex  
- Filters that aren‚Äôt indexed, slowing down queries and reports  
- Processes that only work at small scale but fail under higher volume  

Future-proofing now saves painful rework later.

## Example in Practice

A recent audit uncovered **five active Flows on Opportunity Close**, all trying to update related records differently. Users complained of ‚Äúrandom‚Äù errors. Once consolidated into a single Flow with clear entry conditions, error rates dropped by 80% and the sales team finally trusted the process.

## Key Takeaways

A Health Check isn‚Äôt about pointing fingers‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding opportunities.  

- Eliminate automation overlap to reduce risk.  
- Simplify page layouts for better adoption.  
- Improve data quality to strengthen reporting.  
- Remove scalability blockers before they cause outages.  

Sometimes the biggest wins don‚Äôt come from new features. They come from fixing the foundation and giving your org a clean bill of health for the year ahead.
