You can find endless Salesforce “best practices” online—but that doesn’t mean they’ll work for your org.

At Redwood Lane, we’ve learned that the *right* solution depends entirely on your team, your process, and your goals.

Here’s what we do instead of relying on one-size-fits-all advice:

- **We ask more questions than we answer—at first.**
- **We study your data, usage patterns, and team behavior.**
- **We prototype solutions and test them with real users.**

Smart consulting isn’t just about knowing the tools—it’s about knowing when *not* to use them. That’s where we come in.
