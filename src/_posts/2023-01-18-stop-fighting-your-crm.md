We’ve all seen it—teams using spreadsheets, sticky notes, or side conversations to avoid dealing with their CRM. It’s not laziness—it’s friction.

At Redwood Lane, we help clients **bridge the gap between process and platform** so Salesforce actually *works* the way your team does.

Here’s what we focus on:

- **Listening to users first**, then configuring second
- **Reducing required clicks and fields**—less busywork, more focus
- **Making it easy to do the right thing**, so adoption is a natural outcome

You shouldn’t need to convince your team to use Salesforce. You should make it something they *want* to use. We can help with that.
