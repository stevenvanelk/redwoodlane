The best time to clean up your Salesforce org? Right before it becomes a problem.

At Redwood Lane, we run regular **org health checks** for clients—especially in the spring. Here’s what we look for:

- **Unused fields** that clutter layouts and confuse users
- **Old automation** (especially legacy Workflow Rules) that may still be running behind the scenes
- **Broken reports and dashboards** that no longer reflect real business priorities

We also help document what stays, what goes, and what gets archived—so your system stays lean, fast, and easy to manage.

A clean org is a healthy org. Let’s make it happen.
