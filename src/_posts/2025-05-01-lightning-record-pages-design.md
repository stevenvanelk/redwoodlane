We get it—Flows and Apex get all the attention. But **great Lightning Record Pages** can change how your team works every single day.

Here’s what we focus on:

- **Page layouts that match business flow**, not object structure
- **Tabs and visibility rules** that reduce cognitive overload
- **Highlights, quick actions, and contextual components** that help people do the right thing faster

If your team has to scroll, guess, or tab-hop, your page layout is slowing them down. Let’s fix that.
