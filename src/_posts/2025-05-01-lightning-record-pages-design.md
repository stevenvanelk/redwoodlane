We get it—Flows and Apex get all the attention. But **great Lightning Record Pages** can change how your team works every single day.

## Why Lightning Record Pages Matter

When users complain about Salesforce being “clunky” or “slow,” it’s not always automation or data model issues. Often, the problem is the **record page design**.  

- Too many sections = endless scrolling  
- Important fields buried in side panels = wasted clicks  
- Generic layouts reused everywhere = confusion about what’s relevant  

A well-designed Lightning page makes Salesforce feel more intuitive and keeps people focused on the task at hand.

## What We Focus On

1. **Page layouts that match business flow, not object structure**  
   Users don’t think in terms of “field groups” or “schema.” They think in steps: *qualify a lead, log activity, close a deal.*  
   - Group fields by workflow stage  
   - Put the most important info **above the fold**  
   - Push reference-only data into collapsible sections  

2. **Tabs and visibility rules that reduce cognitive overload**  
   Instead of dumping everything on one screen:  
   - Use **Tabs** for “Details,” “Related,” “Collaboration,” etc.  
   - Apply **Component Visibility** so users only see what matters to them (e.g., show Service fields only to Support, not Sales).  

3. **Highlights, quick actions, and contextual components**  
   - Add key fields to the **Highlights Panel** so users can scan quickly.  
   - Place **Quick Actions** where they make sense—like “Log a Call” or “Send Email” at the top, not buried.  
   - Drop in **Dynamic Related Lists** or custom components to give instant context (open cases, past interactions, key contacts).  

---

## Example in Practice

We once redesigned an Account page where reps had to scroll through **five full screens** to see everything. By reorganizing:

- Key fields moved into the Highlights Panel  
- Activity Timeline given its own tab  
- Service-related components hidden unless the Account Type = “Support”  

Scrolling dropped by 70%. Reps reported they could prep for calls “at a glance” instead of hunting through fields.

## Pro Tips

- **Prototype first** → Spin up a draft page in a sandbox and test with one power user.  
- **Use the App Builder preview** → Test for different form factors (desktop, tablet, phone).  
- **Don’t duplicate layouts** → Use **Dynamic Forms** to reduce the need for dozens of page variations.

## Key Takeaway

Flows and Apex may run the logic, but **page design runs the experience**.  

If your team has to scroll, guess, or tab-hop, your page layout is slowing them down. Invest a little time in Lightning Record Pages, and you’ll give users the gift of focus and speed every time they log in.
