A well-designed Flow can replace dozens of clicks, reduce errors, and improve team experience. At Redwood Lane, we treat Salesforce Flows like infrastructure—because they are.

Here’s how we use them to create real impact for clients:

1. **Lead-to-Opportunity Automation**  
   We set up Flows to qualify and route leads based on smart logic—no more manual handoffs or missed follow-ups.

2. **Onboarding Workflows**  
   New client? New hire? We design Flows that kick off checklists, tasks, and emails the moment a record hits a certain stage.

3. **Alerting and Escalation**  
   Need to know when something’s off? We build intelligent Flows that notify the right person at the right time—automatically.

If your org still relies heavily on manual updates or older tools like Workflow Rules, let’s talk. Flows aren’t just better—they’re the future.
