If you've ever had to update a flow because a picklist value changed or a rule shifted, you already know the pain of hardcoded logic.

One of our favorite ways to reduce that friction is using **Custom Metadata Types** to drive logic in flows. Instead of multiple decision elements tied to static values, we set up records in a metadata type that map inputs to outcomes — think categories, priorities, or assignment rules.

Then in the flow, we use a **Get Records** element to query the matching metadata and determine what to do next.

Benefits?
- Admins can change behavior without modifying the flow
- Logic stays readable, reusable, and scalable
- No more chasing down every branch when something changes

Metadata-driven automation doesn’t just simplify updates — it helps you **build smarter, more resilient flows** from the start.
