Used well, Record Types can clarify business processes, separate workflows, and simplify reporting.

Used poorly? They lead to layout sprawl, automation headaches, and endless picklist management.

Here’s how we make Record Types work *for* your team:

- **We tie them to real business logic**, not just arbitrary categories.
- **We map field visibility and page layouts** carefully, so each type feels tailored.
- **We track impact on automation**—ensuring Flows and rules still behave predictably.

Not every difference needs a Record Type. But when you do need one, it should *add clarity*. We’ll help you find the line.
