Salesforce is flexible—but that doesn’t mean *everything* needs to be custom-built.  

One of the platform’s greatest strengths is how much you can change it. From page layouts and Flows to fully custom Apex code and Lightning Web Components, the options are nearly endless. That flexibility is empowering, but it also comes with a hidden risk: the more you customize, the more complex—and fragile—your org can become.  

The question isn’t “can we build this?” The question is “*should* we build this?” Knowing when to customize, and when to stick with out-of-the-box tools, is what separates a healthy, scalable org from one that feels like it’s always on the verge of breaking.

## Start With Configuration
The first step in solving almost any business need is to look at what Salesforce already provides. Standard features are powerful, tested, and supported by Salesforce directly.  

For example:  
- Can you capture data with a custom field instead of spinning up an entire custom object?  
- Could a Flow or Dynamic Form guide a process instead of requiring custom code?  
- Would conditional visibility on a Lightning page simplify the user experience more effectively than a bespoke component?  

These tools are designed to be flexible for a reason. By starting with configuration, you minimize maintenance overhead and keep solutions easier to understand for the next admin or developer who inherits your org.

## Only Build What Adds Lasting Value
There are times when configuration alone isn’t enough. Complex business logic, integrations with external systems, or user interfaces that need to go beyond standard Lightning functionality may require custom development.  

But customizations should always be judged against their long-term value. Ask questions like:  
- Does this solve a recurring business problem, or is it just addressing a temporary pain point?  
- Will multiple teams or processes benefit from this, or is it narrowly scoped?  
- Can this solution adapt as business priorities shift?  

A good litmus test: if the customization won’t still matter a year from now, it’s worth pausing to ask whether it should be built at all.

## Design With Change in Mind
Even the smartest customization can turn into a headache if it isn’t designed for change. Salesforce evolves constantly, and so do business needs. If a solution can’t adapt, it risks becoming technical debt.  

To design with change in mind:  
- **Keep it modular.** Break down automations into subflows or helper classes so they can be reused or swapped out later.  
- **Document decisions.** Make sure future teams understand why the customization exists and how it was built.  
- **Avoid over-engineering.** A lightweight solution that’s easy to adjust often outlasts a more elaborate one that requires constant upkeep.

## The Risks of Over-Customization
It’s tempting to build every request into the system, but over-customization comes with real costs:  
- **Maintenance burden.** Each new trigger, component, or object adds another layer that must be monitored and updated.  
- **User confusion.** When the system grows too complex, users get lost in features they don’t need.  
- **Slower performance.** Extra logic can lead to slower save times, longer page loads, and general frustration.  
- **Upgrade friction.** Heavily customized orgs may run into compatibility issues when Salesforce releases new features.  

Balancing customization means protecting your org’s agility. The goal is to create solutions that help people work smarter—without painting yourself into a corner.

## Key Takeaways
- **Start simple.** Use Salesforce’s built-in tools before reaching for custom code.  
- **Think long-term.** Build customizations that deliver lasting value, not quick fixes.  
- **Plan for change.** Design with maintenance, documentation, and scalability in mind.  
- **Avoid over-customization.** Too much complexity slows teams down instead of speeding them up.  

The best Salesforce orgs don’t chase customization for its own sake. They strike the right balance—flexible enough to handle today’s needs, but lean enough to adapt for tomorrow.
