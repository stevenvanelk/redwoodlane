Salesforce is flexible—but that doesn’t mean *everything* needs to be custom-built.

At Redwood Lane, we help clients make smart customization decisions. Because the goal isn’t “custom”—it’s **effective**.

Here’s how we think about it:

- **Start With Configuration**  
  Can a field, Flow, or Lightning page solve it? Use the tools Salesforce gives you first.

- **Only Build What Adds Lasting Value**  
  Custom objects, Apex, or LWCs should solve a real, ongoing need—not just this quarter’s pain point.

- **Design With Change in Mind**  
  We always ask: will this be easy to maintain six months from now?

Our best builds aren’t just clever—they’re durable. If your org feels like it’s overbuilt or underperforming, we can help rebalance it.
