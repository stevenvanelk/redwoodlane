            <p>Hi! I'm the founder of Redwood Lane, a dedicated Salesforce consultant specializing in Administration,
                Integrations, Automation, and Reporting.</p>
            <p>With years of experience optimizing Salesforce environments, I’ve helped businesses streamline their
                workflows, improve data management, and automate key processes.</p>

    <p>
        Before diving into the Salesforce ecosystem, I worked as a creative professional in photography and video production.
        Storytelling has always been at the heart of what I do, whether through visuals or digital transformation. Over more
        than 15 years, I built a career helping people communicate their vision—directing shoots, editing films, and producing
        content that connected audiences to a message.
    </p>
    <p>
        That creative foundation shaped how I now approach Salesforce. I see every org as a story in progress: data is the raw
        footage, automation is the editing process, and reports and dashboards are the final cut that reveals the bigger
        picture. My background taught me to listen closely, translate complex needs into clear deliverables, and always keep the
        audience—the end users—at the center of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I transitioned into Salesforce, those same skills carried over naturally. Instead of framing shots or cutting
        sequences, I began designing flows, building apps, and writing Apex. What excites me most today is using Salesforce to
        help organizations tell their story through efficient processes, clean data, and tools that empower teams to focus on
        what really matters.

    <h2>Beyond Salesforce</h2>
    <p>
        When I’m not working with Salesforce, I’m usually spending time with my wife, Jenn, and our three kids. We love getting
        outside together, especially hiking and exploring new trails. At home, you’ll often find us around the table playing
        board games—anything from classics to strategy games that take all night.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m also a lifelong soccer fan, cheering for the Chicago Fire in MLS and Aston Villa in the Premier League. Beyond that,
        I lean into the nerdy side of life: sci-fi books and movies, the occasional video game session, and anything that sparks
        curiosity and imagination. Those hobbies keep me grounded, give me energy, and remind me that creativity doesn’t just
        live in work—it shows up everywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Redwood Lane?</h2>
    <p>
        At Redwood Lane, I bring together my technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and passion for efficiency to help
        businesses get the most out of their Salesforce investment. I focus on building systems that are clean, scalable, and
        easy to maintain—so teams spend less time fighting with their tools and more time focusing on their goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every organization is different, which means no copy-and-paste solutions. I take time to understand how a business
        works, identify what’s slowing it down, and design processes that actually fit the way people use them day to day.
        Whether it’s streamlining workflows, improving data integrity, or unlocking insights through reporting, my goal is
        always the same: to make Salesforce feel like an asset, not an obstacle.
